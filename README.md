## Final Product
Favorites is an iOS application inspired by the fact that friends visiting NYC are always asking me for recommendations of where to eat, drink, shop, etc. in the city. With Favorites, you can save all of your favorite locations to your personal map, add your friends, and see their maps and the updates they post from their locations (and add these locations to your own map to visit later). These are the basics, watch the demo for more details!

## Demo

1. Push Notifications, Map Tab  - adding a pin, pin details
2. Map Tab - center user button, refresh map button, list of pins button, friends button (tap a friend's update - go to the location, add it to your map, go to friend's profile)
3. Map Tab - from friend's profile, see their map of pins/list of pins, Feed Tab - post a new update (choose a photo, choose a location)
4. Feed Tab - choose who to share your update with (add a new group, choose a group), like/unlike
5. Feed Tab - like/unlike, comment, add friends/search for friends button, notifications page
6. Profile Tab - delete updates, delete comments, look at list of friends and get to their profiles that way, edit profile photo, log out

## Planning Stages
### Overview
This app will be a cross between a social media and a self-organization app. The first major tab will be a map in which you can drop pins with your favorite places (under the categories - to shop, to eat, to drink) and when you click on the pin you can see details of the place including pictures (from its instagram or google maps), your own notes, and your categorization of the place using emojis - sneaker emojis for sneaker store etc. You will also be able to add and follow your friends on this app so the second tab will be a timeline where you can post where you are currently shopping/eating/drinking either to just you, a specific group of your friends, or all followers. You will be able to interact with other users' posts through commenting and liking as usual. You can click on your friends' profiles to see their own maps of locations or you can add the locations they are at (to your own map) directly from their posts.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social Media/Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** Uses camera and location, mobile-only experience.
- **Story:** Allows users to save and organize all their favorite places to shop/eat/drink so that when they are in a specific neighborhood or area, they can open the app and see if they have any saved places (or if any of their friends do!) Also allows users to share what they're doing with their friends and see what everyone else is doing. Creates the potential to see who's out/who could meet up.
- **Market:** Anyone who likes to shop/eat/drink and cares about finding new places and remembering their favorites! Also provides the ability to meet up with friends/keep up with friends who live in different cities.
- **Habit:** Whenever you're going out whether it be shopping in another city or for drinks to a bar -- hopefully very habit forming.
- **Scope:** The map tab, timeline tab, and profile tab should be within the scope. Additional features such as sharing to specific groups and maybe in-app messaging might have to be optional stories.
